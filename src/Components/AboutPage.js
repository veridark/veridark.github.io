    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>
      We are a group of Romanian Machine Learning researchers from Bitdefender and from the University Of Bucharest. We
      are interested in Authorship Analysis applied in the cybersecurity context.
    </p>
    <h1>What is the VeriDark project?</h1>
    <h2>Benchmark</h2>
    <p>
      VeriDark provides a benchmark for Authorship Attribution tasks. It contains {tasks_info.tasks.length} tasks
      (Authorship Verification and Authorship Identification) on {datasets_info.datasets.length} newly created datasets.
    </p>
    <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
    <p>
      VeriDark tracks the performance of different models on the previously mentioned datasets and tasks, in order to
      facilitate progress of Authorship Analysis in the cybersecurity context.
    </p>
    <h1>How can you contribute?</h1>
    <p>
      To add your model to the leaderboard, evaluate your modelâ€™s performance and{' '}
      <a href={UrlBuilder.submitPageUrl}>submit</a> your results, together with the paper and/or GitHub repo.
    </p>
