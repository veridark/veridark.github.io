      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>
        We are a group of Romanian Machine Learning researchers from Bitdefender and from the University Of Bucharest.
        We are interested in Authorship Analysis applied in the cybersecurity context.
      </p>
      <h1>What is the VeriDark project?</h1>
      <h2>Benchmark</h2>
      <p>
        VeriDark provides a benchmark for Authorship Analysis tasks. It contains {tasks_info.tasks.length} tasks
        (Authorship Verification and Authorship Identification) on {datasets_info.datasets.length} newly created
        datasets.
      </p>
      <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
      <p>
        VeriDark tracks the performance of different models on the previously mentioned datasets and tasks, in order to
        facilitate progress of Authorship Analysis in the cybersecurity context.
      </p>
      <h1>How can you contribute to the leaderboard?</h1>
      <p>
        To add your model to the leaderboard, evaluate your modelâ€™s performance and{' '}
        <a href={UrlBuilder.submitPageUrl}>submit</a> your results, together with the paper and/or GitHub repo.
      </p>
      <h1>How can you raise an issue with the datasets or request deletion of certain examples?</h1>
      <p>
        The current datasets will be updated to account for potential issues (wrong labels, duplicates etc.) and
        examples containing sensitive information which receive a request for deletion. Please raise these issues or
        file a request for deletion at this <a href="https://forms.gle/1LSA6cvh4daUBxYUA">contact form</a>.
      </p>
